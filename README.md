In Science and engineering often we require the root of transcendental equations and that in a situation when no information is available about the root, 
it is not necessarily be whole number and difficult to find by conventional Mathematics methods. 
In general to compute numerical value of the root, 
we need to find an approximate root value that satisfies our need with a minimum number of iterations for this.  
This project contains the implementation of some numerical methods for solving transcendental equations:
1. [**Bisection Method**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method) (also known as the **Interval Halving Method** and the **Dichotomy Method**)
2. [**Secant Method**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_method) (also known as the **Method of Chords** and the **Method of Proportional parts**)
3. [**Newton's Method**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) (also known as the **Newton–Raphson Method** and the **Method of Tangents**)
4. [**Combined Method**](http://cyclowiki.org/wiki/Комбинированный_метод)
5. [**Simple Iteration Method**](https://encyclopediaofmath.org/wiki/Simple-iteration_method#:~:text=A%20particular%20case%20of%20the,minimal%20with%20respect%20to%20τ.)
6. [**Muller's Method**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-muller-method/)
